# Spooky

Spooky lets HAProxy, NGINX, and Apache environments adopt QUIC/HTTP/3 in days instead of quarters.

## Overview

Modern clients increasingly expect HTTP/3 support, but most production backends still use HTTP/2. Spooky bridges this gap by:

- Terminating QUIC connections with TLS 1.3
- Converting HTTP/3 streams to HTTP/2 requests
- Load balancing across backend pools with health checks
- Supporting path and host-based routing
- Enforcing bounded request/response memory with deterministic overload failures

## Performance

On a laptop (Intel i5-11320H, 4 physical cores, 15 GiB RAM), loopback backends:

| Scenario | Throughput | Success | p99 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Burst (120 concurrent) | **21,235 req/s** | 100% | 102 ms |
| Burst (80 concurrent) | **14,691 req/s** | 100% | 65 ms |
| Slow upstream (80 concurrent) | **9,549 req/s** | 100% | 62 ms |
| QUIC packet loss (120 concurrent) | **12,500 req/s** | 100% | 91 ms |

See [load test results](docs/benchmarks/load.md) for full details.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Build release binary
cargo build --release

# Generate self-signed certificates
make certs-selfsigned

# Run with default configuration
./target/release/spooky --config config/config.development.yaml

# Test with HTTP/3 client
curl --http3-only -k \
  --resolve proxy.spooky.local:9889:127.0.0.1 \
  https://proxy.spooky.local:9889/api/health
```

## System Requirements

- **Rust**: 1.85 or later (edition 2024)
- **OS**: Linux
- **Permissions**: Root is only required for privileged ports (`<1024`); non-privileged ports run unprivileged
- **Network**: UDP port access for QUIC traffic
- **Memory**: 256MB minimum, 1GB recommended

### Build Dependencies

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install cmake build-essential pkg-config

# macOS
brew install cmake pkg-config
```

## Configuration

Spooky uses YAML configuration with validation at startup. See [configuration reference](docs/configuration/reference.md) for complete documentation.

Repository config templates:

- `config/config.production.yaml`: secure production baseline (`upstream_tls.verify_certificates=true`)
- `config/config.development.yaml`: explicit local-development profile (allows insecure upstream TLS)
- `config/config.sample.yaml`: full reference sample with all major sections

### Ingress Compatibility Posture

Spooky uses **HTTP/3 over QUIC** as its native ingress data plane and also runs a **TLS bootstrap ingress** for HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 clients.

- Native path: HTTP/3 over QUIC on UDP.
- Compatibility path: HTTP/1.1 + HTTP/2 over TLS on TCP for modern browser compatibility and `Alt-Svc` discovery/upgrade to HTTP/3.
- External frontends (CDN/LB/reverse proxy) are still supported when you want additional edge policy, WAF, or protocol mediation.

### Minimal Example

```yaml
version: 1

listen:
  protocol: http3
  port: 9889
  address: "0.0.0.0"
  tls:
    cert: "certs/cert.pem"
    key: "certs/key.pem"

upstream:
  api_backend:
    load_balancing:
      type: "round-robin"
    route:
      path_prefix: "/api"
    backends:
      - id: "api-1"
        address: "127.0.0.1:8001"
        weight: 100
        health_check:
          path: "/health"
          interval: 5000

  default_backend:
    load_balancing:
      type: "random"
    route:
      path_prefix: "/"
    backends:
      - id: "default-1"
        address: "127.0.0.1:8080"
        weight: 100
        health_check:
          path: "/health"
          interval: 5000

log:
  level: info
```

### Key Configuration Features

**Upstream Pools**: Define multiple named upstream groups. Each pool configures its own routing rules and load balancing strategy independently.

**Routing**: Route requests based on path prefix and hostname. The most specific match (longest prefix) wins.

**Load Balancing**: Per-upstream pool strategies: random, round-robin, consistent-hash, least-connections, latency-aware, and sticky-cid.

**Health Checks**: Automatic backend health monitoring with configurable intervals, timeouts, and thresholds.

## Architecture

Spooky uses a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

        direction TB

        end

            metrics["Metrics Endpoint<br/>Route SLOs (P50/P95/P99)"]
        end
    end

    ingress --> workers
    pool -->|HTTP/2| backend["Backend Servers"]
    health -. health state .-> pool
    workers -. route/outcome metrics .-> metrics
```

## Project Status

**Beta.** Spooky is feature-complete for core HTTP/3 edge proxying and can be used in controlled production rollouts. It remains pre-GA, so operators should follow the deployment hardening guidance and roll out progressively.

See [release maturity](docs/release-maturity.md) for scope and GA exit criteria, and [roadmap](docs/roadmap.md) for planned improvements.
