## Top-Level Configuration

### version

Configuration schema version.

| Property | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `version` | integer | No | 1 | Configuration schema version |

### listen

Server listening configuration. Defines the protocol, address, and port for incoming client connections.

### upstream

Named upstream pool definitions. Each key represents a unique upstream pool with its own routing rules, load balancing strategy, and backend servers.

### load_balancing

Optional global fallback for upstream load balancing. If an upstream omits `upstream.<name>.load_balancing`, the top-level `load_balancing` value is applied to that upstream during config load.

### log

Logging configuration. Controls log level and output formatting.

## Listen Configuration

Configures the listening interface for incoming client connections. HTTP/3 requires TLS configuration.

### Properties

| Property | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `protocol` | string | No | `http3` | Protocol to listen on |
| `address` | string | No | `0.0.0.0` | IP address to bind to |
| `port` | integer | No | `9889` | Port to bind to |
| `tls` | object | Yes | - | TLS configuration (required for HTTP/3) |

### Protocol Values

listen:
  protocol: http3
  address: "0.0.0.0"
  port: 9889
  tls:
    cert: "/etc/spooky/certs/server.crt"
    key: "/etc/spooky/certs/server.key"

# Localhost-only development
listen:
  protocol: http3
  address: "127.0.0.1"
  port: 9889
  tls:
    cert: "certs/localhost.crt"
    key: "certs/localhost.key"
```

## Upstream Configuration

Upstream pools define groups of backend servers with routing rules and load balancing strategies. Each upstream pool is identified by a unique name and contains routing criteria, load balancing configuration, and backend definitions.

### Structure

```yaml
upstream:
  pool_name:
    load_balancing: <LoadBalancing>
    route: <RouteMatch>
    backends: [<Backend>]
```

### Properties

| Property | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `load_balancing` | object | No | round-robin | Per-upstream load balancing algorithm configuration |
| `route` | object | Yes | - | Route matching criteria |
| `backends` | array | Yes | - | List of backend servers |

### Route Matching

Route matching determines which upstream pool handles a request. Routes are evaluated by longest-prefix matching across all configured upstreams, selecting the route with the most specific (longest) path prefix.

#### RouteMatch Properties

| Property | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `host` | string | No | - | Host header to match (e.g., `api.example.com`) |
| `path_prefix` | string | No | - | Path prefix to match (e.g., `/api`) |
| `method` | string | No | - | HTTP method to match (reserved for future use) |

Route matching rules:

1. If `host` is specified, the request Host header must match exactly
2. If `path_prefix` is specified, the request path must start with the prefix
3. If both are specified, both conditions must match
4. Routes are evaluated by longest-prefix matching - the route with the most specific (longest) path prefix is selected
5. For equal-length prefixes, ties are deterministic: host-specific routes win over host-agnostic routes, then lexicographically smaller upstream name wins

#### Route Examples

```yaml
# Host-based routing
upstream:
  api_pool:
    route:
      host: "api.example.com"
    backends: [...]

  web_pool:
    route:
      host: "www.example.com"
    backends: [...]

# Path-based routing
upstream:
  api_pool:
    route:
      path_prefix: "/api"
    backends: [...]

  admin_pool:
    route:
      path_prefix: "/admin"
    backends: [...]

  default_pool:
    route:
      path_prefix: "/"
    backends: [...]

# Combined host and path routing
upstream:
  api_v2_pool:
    route:
      host: "api.example.com"
      path_prefix: "/v2"
    backends: [...]

  api_v1_pool:
    route:
      host: "api.example.com"
      path_prefix: "/v1"
    backends: [...]
```

### Backend Configuration

Each backend represents an upstream server that can handle requests.

#### Backend Properties

| Property | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `id` | string | Yes | - | Unique identifier for the backend |
| `address` | string | Yes | - | Backend server address. Accepted forms: `host:port` (defaults to `https://`), `https://host:port`, `http://host:port` |
| `weight` | integer | No | `100` | Load balancing weight (higher values receive more traffic) |
| `health_check` | object | Yes | - | Health check configuration |

**Address format notes:**
- `host:port` — shorthand, treated as `https://host:port`
- `https://host:port` — TLS connection; certificate verification is currently skipped (self-signed certs are accepted)
- `http://host:port` — plain HTTP/1.1 only; HTTP/2 over cleartext (h2c) is not supported

#### Health Check Configuration

Health checks monitor backend availability and automatically remove unhealthy backends from the pool.

| Property | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `path` | string | No | `/health` | HTTP path for health check requests |
| `interval` | integer | No | `5000` | Health check interval in milliseconds |
| `timeout_ms` | integer | No | `1000` | Health check timeout in milliseconds |
| `failure_threshold` | integer | No | `3` | Consecutive failures before marking unhealthy |
| `success_threshold` | integer | No | `2` | Consecutive successes before marking healthy |
| `cooldown_ms` | integer | No | `5000` | Cooldown period after marking unhealthy (milliseconds) |

Health check behavior:

1. Health checks are performed at the specified `interval`
2. A backend is marked unhealthy after `failure_threshold` consecutive failures
3. An unhealthy backend enters cooldown for `cooldown_ms` milliseconds
4. After cooldown, health checks resume
5. A backend is marked healthy after `success_threshold` consecutive successes

#### Backend Examples

```yaml
# Minimal backend configuration
backends:
  - id: "backend1"
    address: "10.0.1.10:8080"
    health_check:
      path: "/health"

# Weighted backend with custom health checks
backends:
  - id: "backend1"
    address: "10.0.1.10:8080"
    weight: 100
    health_check:
      path: "/api/health"
      interval: 10000
      timeout_ms: 2000
      failure_threshold: 5
      success_threshold: 3
      cooldown_ms: 10000

  - id: "backend2"
    address: "10.0.1.11:8080"
    weight: 200
    health_check:
      path: "/api/health"
      interval: 10000

# Multiple backends with different health endpoints
backends:
  - id: "primary"
    address: "10.0.1.10:8080"
    weight: 150
    health_check:
      path: "/status"
      interval: 5000

  - id: "secondary"
    address: "10.0.1.11:8080"
    weight: 100
    health_check:
      path: "/healthz"
      interval: 5000
```

## Load Balancing Configuration

Load balancing determines how requests are distributed across healthy backends within an upstream pool. Each pool configures its own strategy independently.

### Properties

| Property | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `type` | string | Yes | - | Load balancing algorithm |
| `key` | string | No | - | Hash key source for consistent hashing (planned feature) |

### Supported Algorithms

#### random

Selects a backend randomly from all healthy backends. Weight values are currently ignored (weighted random is planned for future release).

```yaml
upstream:
  my_pool:
    load_balancing:
      type: "random"
```

#### round-robin

Distributes requests evenly across all healthy backends in sequential order. Weight values are currently ignored (weighted round-robin is planned for future release).

```yaml
upstream:
  my_pool:
    load_balancing:
      type: "round-robin"
```

#### consistent-hash

Routes requests using consistent hashing based on a fixed key derived from the request. Currently uses request authority (if present), otherwise request path, otherwise HTTP method.

**Note**: Configurable key sources (headers, cookies, query parameters) are planned for future implementation.

```yaml
upstream:
  my_pool:
    load_balancing:
      type: "consistent-hash"
      # key: "header:x-user-id"  # Planned feature, not currently supported
```

### Algorithm Selection

- Use `random` for simple stateless load distribution
- Use `round-robin` for even distribution across backends
- Use `consistent-hash` when session affinity or request consistency is required

### Examples

```yaml
upstream:
  api_pool:
    load_balancing:
      type: "consistent-hash"
    route:
      path_prefix: "/api"
    backends: [...]

  default_pool:
    load_balancing:
      type: "round-robin"
    route:
      path_prefix: "/"
    backends: [...]
```

## Logging Configuration

Controls logging output, verbosity, and destination.

### Properties

| Property | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `level` | string | No | `info` | Log level |
| `format` | string | No | `plain` | Output format: `plain` (human-readable) or `json` (structured) |
| `file.enabled` | bool | No | `false` | Write logs to a file instead of stderr |
| `file.path` | string | No | `/var/log/spooky/spooky.log` | Log file path (used when `file.enabled` is `true`) |

### Log Levels

Log levels in order of increasing verbosity:

- `silence`: No logging output
- `poltergeist`: Error messages only
- `scream`: Warnings and errors
- `spooky`: Informational messages, warnings, and errors
- `haunt`: Debug information
- `whisper`: Trace-level debugging

Standard log level mapping:

- `silence` = off
- `poltergeist` = error
- `scream` = warn
- `spooky` = info
- `haunt` = debug
- `whisper` = trace

### Examples

```yaml
# stderr only (default)
log:
  level: info
  format: plain

# Write to file
log:
  level: info
  format: plain
  file:
    enabled: true
    path: /var/log/spooky/spooky.log

# Structured JSON logs (recommended for log pipelines)
log:
  level: info
  format: json

# Development — debug to stderr
log:
  level: haunt  # debug level
  format: plain

# Troubleshooting — trace to file
log:
  level: whisper  # trace level
  format: json
  file:
    enabled: true
    path: /tmp/spooky-trace.log
```

| `new_connections_burst` | integer | No | `500` | Burst capacity above the steady-state rate; the bucket starts full so the first burst of legitimate connections always succeeds |
| `max_active_connections` | integer | No | `20000` | Hard cap on active QUIC connections per worker; unknown `Initial` packets are dropped once this cap is reached |
| `quic_max_idle_timeout_ms` | integer | No | `5000` | QUIC idle timeout in ms; connection is closed after this period of inactivity |
| `quic_initial_max_data` | integer | No | `10000000` | Connection-level QUIC flow control window in bytes |

### Connection flood protection

`new_connections_per_sec` and `new_connections_burst` implement a token-bucket rate limiter on new QUIC connection accepts. The bucket starts full so legitimate burst traffic at startup is never penalised. Packets for **existing** connections are never affected by this limit — only unknown `Initial` packets that would create a new connection state entry are gated.

`max_active_connections` is a separate hard guardrail for total connection state. Use it to enforce deterministic memory limits under sustained handshake floods even when token-bucket limits allow temporary bursts.

```yaml
performance:
  new_connections_per_sec: 2000   # refill rate: 2 k new conns/sec
  new_connections_burst: 500      # allow a burst of up to 500 above the rate
  max_active_connections: 20000   # hard ceiling for concurrently tracked connections
```

Set `new_connections_burst` to `1` and `new_connections_per_sec` to a low value to aggressively throttle connection floods at the cost of rejecting legitimate concurrent handshakes.

### Examples

```yaml
# Single-worker, conservative limits
performance:
  worker_threads: 1
  global_inflight_limit: 1024
  new_connections_per_sec: 500
  new_connections_burst: 100

  worker_threads: 8
  reuseport: true
  pin_workers: true
  global_inflight_limit: 16384
  per_upstream_inflight_limit: 4096
  per_backend_inflight_limit: 256
  new_connections_per_sec: 10000
  new_connections_burst: 2000
```

| `unhealthy_consecutive_windows` | integer | No | `3` | Consecutive unhealthy windows before invoking the restart hook |
| `drain_grace_ms` | integer | No | `8000` | Grace period (ms) to drain connections before restarting |
| `restart_cooldown_ms` | integer | No | `120000` | Minimum time (ms) between restart hook invocations |
| `restart_hook` | string | No | `null` | Shell command invoked on restart trigger |

### Startup Validation Errors

The following resilience configurations are rejected at startup with a descriptive error:

| Condition | Error |
|-----------|-------|
| `recover_inflight_percent >= trigger_inflight_percent` | brownout hysteresis inverted |
| `adaptive_admission.min_limit == 0` | min_limit must be > 0 |
| `retry_budget.ratio_percent > 100` | ratio_percent must be 0–100 |
| `hedging.enabled && delay_ms == 0` | delay_ms must be > 0 when hedging is enabled |

### Example

```yaml
resilience:
  adaptive_admission:
    enabled: true
    min_limit: 64
    high_latency_ms: 500

  circuit_breaker:
    enabled: true
    failure_threshold: 3
    open_ms: 30000
    half_open_max_probes: 1

  retry_budget:
    enabled: true
    ratio_percent: 10

  hedging:
    enabled: false
    delay_ms: 100

  brownout:
    enabled: true
    trigger_inflight_percent: 90
    recover_inflight_percent: 60
    core_routes:
      - "auth_pool"
      - "payments_pool"
```

## Configuration Validation

Spooky validates configuration at startup and reports errors before attempting to start the server.

### Common Validation Errors

1. **Missing required fields**
   - TLS certificate or key paths not specified
   - Backend address or ID missing
   - Route configuration empty

2. **Invalid file paths**
   - TLS certificate file not found or not readable
   - TLS key file not found or not readable
   - Incorrect file permissions

3. **Invalid values**
   - Port number out of range (1-65535)
   - Invalid IP address format
   - Invalid backend address format (must be `host:port`)
   - Duplicate backend IDs within a pool

4. **Configuration conflicts**
   - Port already in use
   - Duplicate upstream pool names
   - Overlapping or ambiguous route definitions
   - Brownout `recover_inflight_percent` ≥ `trigger_inflight_percent`
   - `adaptive_admission.min_limit` set to 0
   - `retry_budget.ratio_percent` > 100
   - `hedging.enabled` with `delay_ms` = 0

### Testing Configuration

Validate configuration without starting the server:

```bash
spooky --config <path>
```

The command exits with status 0 if configuration is valid, or prints detailed error messages and exits with non-zero status if invalid.
