//! Canonical request/response conversion surface for upstream bridging.
//!
//! Consumers should use:
//! - [`request`] for upstream request construction and header policy application
//! - [`response`] for downstream response normalization and emission policy
//! - [`websocket`] for websocket and upgrade helpers
//!
//! Protocol-specific H1/H2 builders are internal implementation details behind
//! the canonical request-building surface.
